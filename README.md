# Odin-Weather-App

This is my attempt at the Weather App Project set by the Odin Project.

This Web App uses OpenWeathers Weather API to fetch the data required to display the users current and future weather forecast.

This Web App can also use the browsers location data to automate the weather forecast fetching for the user if they have locational data enabled in their browser.
